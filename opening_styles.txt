Begin with a metaphor drawn from light, breath, or trees.
Open with a sensory detail — something heard, felt, or smelled.
Start with a single image — a leaf, a shadow, a window.
Avoid passive openings. Begin mid-moment, as if we've arrived in the middle of something.
Let the first line feel like a question without a question mark.
Start with something still, then reveal its motion.
Use an unusual metaphor that doesn’t involve light or water.
Begin with an act of noticing — something overlooked.
Start with something fleeting: wind, mist, or echo.
Open with a color or texture rather than a thing.
Imagine the reader is pausing on a staircase. Begin there.
Start with quiet movement: pages turning, leaves shifting.
Begin with something dissolving or fading.
Begin at the end of a sentence someone else spoke.
Start with the feel of a breath or heartbeat.
Use a sound as the first sense.
Begin with something turning, growing, or unfolding.
Start at the edge of a boundary: door, threshold, window, hill.
Let the opening feel like remembering something you almost forgot.
Avoid abstraction. Start with something the body knows.
Start with the weather, but not in a cliché — make it personal.
Begin with a silence that is meaningful.
Let the first line interrupt something unseen.
Start in the middle of a small ritual — making tea, tying shoes, opening a door.
Open with an image of motion followed by stillness.
Begin by describing something backwards.
Start from the perspective of a tree, a shadow, or a chair.
Let the first line contain two senses in contrast — warm and sharp, rough and fragrant.
Begin with a detail others would miss — lint, condensation, a loose thread.
Start from a place the speaker doesn’t belong but is welcome anyway.
Use a metaphor that implies distance or scale — a star, a canyon, a pinhole.
Begin inside a building no one notices anymore.
Start in a hallway, not a destination.
Let the opening image be something forgotten until now.
Begin as if describing a moment right before something meaningful happens.
