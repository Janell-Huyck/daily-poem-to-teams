Begin with a breath or small movement unnoticed by most.
Open with a fleeting sound, like water, wings, or whispering.
Start from a stillness that is about to shift.
Let the first image be something dissolving: mist, smoke, shadow.
Begin with the feeling of something leaving or changing.
Start with an overlooked detail: a crack in stone, a flicker of light, worn wood.
Imagine standing at the boundary between seasons — begin there.
Let the haiku start as if the world is holding its breath.
Begin with a simple touch: cool air, warm stone, rough bark.
Start as if you almost missed what you are noticing.
Begin with the space between two moments — not the moment itself.
Open with an image that suggests both presence and absence.
Let the haiku emerge from silence, not from action.
