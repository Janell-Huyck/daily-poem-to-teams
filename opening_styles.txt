Start with a single natural image: a leaf, a cloud, a stone.

Open with a fleeting motion: a gust of wind, rippling water.

Begin at the quiet edge of a moment: dusk, mist, breath.

Use a color or texture without naming the object.

Let the first line describe a sound barely heard.

Begin with the stillness before change: frozen dew, unmoving air.

Start inside a moment of transition: falling leaves, shifting light.

Describe a small unnoticed detail: a crack in a wall, a worn step.

Use contrast in temperature: a cold breeze on warm skin.

Start at the boundary between two things: shore and sea, light and shadow.

Let the first line feel unfinished, like a breath waiting to be taken.

Begin with something dissolving or fading: scent, echo, mist.

Focus on something vanishing or newly appearing.

Begin with a sensation rather than a thought.

Describe motion within stillness: branches trembling slightly.

Start with a silent interaction: eye contact, a nod, a shared breath.

Capture a moment between two beats: between footfalls, between words.

Use a metaphor tied to seasons without naming the season directly.

Start from the perspective of a still object: a stone, a chair, a leaf.

Describe the smallest thing in the scene, not the largest.
